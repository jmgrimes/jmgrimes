# Software Architect, Husband, Board Gamer, Dungeon Master, and All Around Geek.
Hi, my name is Jonah! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and Solutions Architect living in Lexington, Kentucky. I spent a decent chunk of my career in the Java and Spring Framework Framework ecosystem before turning my attention to the cloud, building solutions on Amazon Web Services. I maintain all of the AWS associate and professional certifications, am an active member of the Bluegrass Developer's Guild, and focus most of my current work on web applications written in Typescript with Angular, GraphQL, Nest.js, Next.js, and React. In my spare time, I enjoy board games, tabletop role playing games, craft beer, distillery touring, ice hockey, playing guitar, and learning just about anything!
